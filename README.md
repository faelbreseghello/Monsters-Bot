A simple Monsters Inc. Discord bot made by `faelbreseghello#3092`.
This bot is developed for my Monsters Inc. server. *[Click here to join](https://discord.gg/ZgSayUW).*
<br>
You can't add it to your server with an invite, but if you want to host it by yourself you can without any problem! Scroll down to see how!
 
## Features
* Simple code, using discord.py! (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)!
* A minigame to "claim" messages, that will generate a rank. The minigame's name is *Scare floor*!
* Clear code!
* Administrative and logging commands!
* A lot of fun commands, including memes and quotes!
